#The idea behind this should be to exploit the strengths of the Wii balance board as much as possible and build upon knowledge of PI APIs
#
#Unresolved questions:
#
#	how do we persist data? (free aws)
#	how do we enable voice control? 
#	how do we feedback? voice sampler + speaker? 
#	how do we test locally on PC? (do we need to?) 
#	how do we permanently pair the board? 
#	how do we power both devices through single supply?
